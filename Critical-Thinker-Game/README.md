# Critical Thinker: Real Events Challenge

## Objective
Enhance players' critical thinking skills by presenting them with real-world or simulated events and challenging them to make informed decisions or provide well-reasoned responses.

## Gameplay

### Event Selection
Players are presented with a menu of different events. These events can be real-world news stories or fictional scenarios inspired by real events. They should cover a wide range of topics, such as social issues, ethics, economics, politics, and more.

### Event Presentation
After selecting an event, the game presents a detailed description of the situation, including background information, context, and key stakeholders involved. This presentation should be engaging and immersive.

### Question Phase
The player enters the "Question Phase," where they are asked a series of questions related to the chosen event. These questions can be multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, or open-ended. The questions should require critical thinking and encourage players to analyze the situation from different angles.

### Answer Phase
Players provide their answers to the questions. For open-ended questions, players can type short responses, and for multiple-choice questions, they can select the most appropriate option.

### Feedback and Scoring
After answering the questions, the game provides feedback on the player's responses. It should explain the correct answers and offer insights into the reasoning behind them. Players earn points based on the accuracy and depth of their responses.

### Discussion Mode
Similar to your previous game idea, you can include an optional discussion mode where players can engage in a virtual debate or discussion about the event. They can present their viewpoints and arguments, and the game can provide counterarguments or alternative perspectives to encourage critical thinking.

### Progression
As players complete events and answer questions correctly, they can unlock more challenging events, additional features, or earn virtual rewards.

### Leaderboards and Social Sharing
Implement leaderboards to encourage competition and allow players to share their scores and achievements on social media.
